# Changes Made - Confidence Scoring Integration

## ‚úÖ ACTUAL CHANGES TO YOUR CODE

### 1. Backend Changes (`standalone_backend.py`)

#### Added Imports (Lines 21-28):
```python
# Confidence scoring imports
from qa_agent.task_confidence_checker import task_confidence_checker
from qa_agent.api.routes.approvals import (
    router as approvals_router,
    approval_manager,
    ApprovalRequest,
    broadcast_approval_update
)
```

#### Registered Approvals Router (Lines 54-55):
```python
# Register approvals router for confidence scoring
app.include_router(approvals_router, prefix="/api/v1")
```

#### Replaced Browser-Use Endpoint (Lines 684-795):
The entire `/api/v1/qa-tests/browser-use/execute` endpoint was replaced with a new version that:
- Analyzes the task BEFORE execution
- Creates approval request if task is risky
- Waits for user approval
- Only executes if approved or safe

### 2. Frontend Changes (`QuickTest.jsx`)

#### Added Import (Line 3):
```jsx
import ApprovalPrompt from '../components/ApprovalPrompt'
```

#### Added Component (Lines 321-322):
```jsx
{/* Confidence Scoring Approval Prompt */}
<ApprovalPrompt apiBaseUrl="http://localhost:8000" />
```

## üì¶ New Files Created

1. `qa_agent/task_confidence_checker.py` - Risk analysis engine
2. `qa_agent/api/routes/approvals.py` - Approval API endpoints
3. `frontend/src/components/ApprovalPrompt.jsx` - Approval UI modal
4. Documentation files (guides, examples)

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
python standalone_backend.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Safe Task
Go to Quick Test page and enter:
```
Go to example.com and click About
```
**Expected:** Executes immediately without prompt

### 4. Test Risky Task
Enter:
```
Go to wisemarket.com.pk, add product to cart, and complete the checkout
```
**Expected:** Shows approval modal with:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è APPROVAL REQUIRED
- Risk Level: CRITICAL
- Confidence: 45%
- Detected Operations: Checkout process
- Two buttons: "Deny & Stop" and "Approve & Continue"

### 5. Test the Approval
- Click "Deny & Stop" ‚Üí Task won't execute, browser won't open
- Click "Approve & Continue" ‚Üí Task proceeds, browser opens

## üîç What to Look For

### Backend Console Output
When a risky task is submitted, you should see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Task requires approval - Risk: CRITICAL, Confidence: 45%
```

Then either:
```
‚úÖ Task execution approved by user
```
or
```
‚ùå Task execution denied by user or timed out
```

### Frontend
- A modal should pop up immediately when risky task is submitted
- Modal should show:
  - Risk level badge (colored based on severity)
  - Confidence percentage
  - Task description
  - Reasoning
  - Risk factors
  - Countdown timer (60 seconds)
  - Two action buttons

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
Make sure all new files were created:
```bash
ls qa_agent/task_confidence_checker.py
ls qa_agent/api/routes/approvals.py
ls frontend/src/components/ApprovalPrompt.jsx
```

### Modal not appearing
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Make sure frontend is running on http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:3000
3. Verify backend is running on http://localhost:8000
4. Check CORS settings (should be allow all origins)

### All tasks require approval
This means your keywords are too broad. Check the task description against patterns in `task_confidence_checker.py`

### No approval required for risky task
Check if the task contains keywords like:
- checkout, purchase, buy, payment, delete, etc.
